1)	when i moved the templated functions to the .CPP file, i got compilation errors, functions were not found. when everyting was moved to the 
.H file, the code would not compile due to errors, multiple defined symbols found.

2)	after moving one templated function over to ws9_lab.cpp. i was unable to compile my code. i tried before and after the main function and also
inside the main function but i could still not compile correctly.

3)	yes i belive i could have done this lab without the use of templates but it would have made it alot more difficult. i would need to make the 
function multiple times with differant signitures in order to be able to accept differant type of parameters.

4)	yes the two examples are the same but there may be certian cases where you would need to use one over the other.
