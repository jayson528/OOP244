1) a safe empy state is just reffering to when a variable is initinied to a predefined value that youve set, for example a safe empty state for 
	an int variable called age could be 0, instead of the garbage number we get if its left not initilized. any state could be a safe empty
	as ong as its a state that you know youve set, for example a safe empty state for a tring could be "name" thats set by you. you know its
	a safe empty state because no ones name is "name" and if the variable has the word "name" in it, you can assume thats its empty and ready
	to be used.

2) we can minimize code duplication a number of ways, for example in an object constructor with parameters, if the parameters are invalid, we can
	use "this." to reffer to the defult contructor to set the safe empty state insead of writing the code again.

3) in the canTravelWith() memeber, they can access other objets private data becasue both objects are of the same type and made with the same 
	constructor, so they have acess to each others private data.

5) I have learned about constructors and how they work and how they need to be implemented.

1)the defult constructor is called automatically when the object is first created to initilize the memebers to a safe empty state.
